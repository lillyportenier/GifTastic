# GifTastic

This is a web app that pulls gifs from the Giphy API, you simply need to search a key word or phrase in the input box and it will automatically populate the page with gifs and the ratings of each. It also has a feature to start and stop the gifs or change them from still images to moving images. 
The user is able to choose from the given keywords but is also welcome to add new buttons with new keywords, that when pressed will repopulate the page with the new keyword selected.
